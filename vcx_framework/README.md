# VCX Framework (VCX-F)

The VCX Framework (VCX-F) provides a simple and easy to use framework built on top of VCX to provide Aries methods, including the management of DIDComm connection and the exchange of AnonCreds credentials.

This framework provides cooridinating behaviors on top of VCX, including record persistance, message delivery and processing, and mediator cooridination. VCX Framework is available for use in Rust, Android (Kotlin), and iOS (Swift). Other platforms, including React Native and Flutter will be considered in the future.

> [!WARNING]  
> This framework is under active development -- expect changes, issues, and further awesome things. Proceed at your own risk!
